This bash script helps you perform whois lookups on multiple domains simultaneously

I have designed a highly efficient tool that is intended to save a significant amount of time while delivering quick results. Here are the detailed steps to utilize this tool:

1. Download the script and grant permissions by using the command: chmod +x "file name". This command ensures that the script has the necessary permissions to run on your system.

2. Once the permissions have been granted, run the script by using the command: ./Whois_lookup_by_yashethics.sh domain.txt. This command invokes the script and initiates the process of conducting Whois lookups on all domains listed in the domain.txt file.

3. Make sure to provide the domain.txt file to the script so that it can perform Whois lookups on all domains listed in the file. This file should contain all of the domains that you wish to retrieve Whois information on.

By following these steps, you will be able to utilize this tool to conduct Whois lookups on multiple domains quickly and efficiently. If you have any questions or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
